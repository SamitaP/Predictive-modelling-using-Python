# Predictive-modelling-using-Python

The attached file uses breast cancer dataset from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
Using this data, I have created a model using K Nearest neighbor algorithm and the data is split using cross validation by splitting 75% data as training dataset and 25% data as test dataset.
This program can predict if the cancer is benign or malignant using previously created model on the basis of values provided.
